// Time Complexity : Total time taken by a program to run as a fuction of of length of the input
// Big(O) : Worst Case       Omega(Ω):Best case        Theta(θ): Average case

// for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
//     cout<<"Something";
// }
// total no to steps to execute teh program: 4+3+3+3+3+.....+n =>[3n+1] => Wost case complexity
// we doesnot include Constants in calculation as thet play negligible change to TC for Best case
// WORST CASE[Big(O)]: [3n+1]={O(n)}
